    "Our mission is to inform Lexington residents accurately by providing instant, well-cited answers to frequently asked questions about the "
    "school building project, including financial details and voting logistics. Beyond delivering reliable information, the chatbot is designed to "
    "raise awareness and boost engagement through its interactive interface, which prompts users with suggested follow-up questions to deepen "
    "their understanding of key issues. Additionally, the tool will gather and analyze user feedbackâ€”tracking recurring questions, response satisfaction, "
    "and knowledge gaps. By combining education, engagement, and data-driven insights, this project aims to foster an informed and participatory community "
    "ahead of the vote."
